## Store Object
- stocked items (A through Z)
- logic for restocking
  - how often does the store restock
  - track stock levels over time
- Stock capacity
- Items expunged (Too old, no more room)

### Stocked Item
- lifespan (default to 7)
- When Created

## Person Object
- Preference (list of items desired)
- Happy indicator
- Sad indicator (when they can't get what they want)


the goal is to run the modelling over a time-period to see what happens when the restock logic just operates on consumption vs consumption + pricing.
key things to track are Store trash (how much stock is thrown out) and Person happy/sad amounts.
